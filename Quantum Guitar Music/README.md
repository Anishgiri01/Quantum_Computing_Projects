# Quantum_Guitar_random

With this code, you can input a text file that contains guitar notes that you want to play at certain times. The code asks for an input file (supposed to be .txt file) and will generate an output  file (speficy the file name in .dat format, for example: test.dat) that contains frequencies at particular time. Note that after the execution is completed, a dat file will be downloaded in your project directory. You can use the following link to convert .dat file into .wav file to hear the music: https://www.media.io/convert/dat-to-wav.html

This code uses a random number generator using Qiskit. This project can be a good example of how someone can integrate quantum computing components in a CS project.
